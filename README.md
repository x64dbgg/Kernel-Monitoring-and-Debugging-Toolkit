# Toolkit

This project is designed to offer a deep dive into kernel memory management, and system call tracing, making it an invaluable resource for developers and researchers working on kernel-level programming and security.
## Features

    Kernel Memory Inspector: Allows detailed inspection of kernel memory regions, providing functionalities to read, write, and monitor changes.
    System Call Tracer: Intercepts and logs system calls, providing detailed analysis of arguments, return values, and execution paths.
    Process and Thread Monitor: Tracks process and thread creation, termination, and context switches, offering insights into process management and scheduling.
    Kernel Object Tracker: Monitors and logs kernel object creation and deletion, helping to detect resource leaks and improper handling.
    Dynamic Module Loader: Supports loading and unloading kernel modules dynamically, including features to resolve dependencies and manage module lifecycle.
    Advanced Hooking Framework: Provides a framework for hooking various kernel functions, enabling customization and enhancement of kernel behaviors.
    Security Event Logger: Captures and logs security-related events such as privilege escalations, suspicious behavior, and unauthorized access attempts.
    Kernel Patch Guard Bypass: Includes mechanisms to bypass PatchGuard for research purposes (use responsibly and understand legal implications).
    Virtual Memory Map: Generates a detailed map of virtual memory, showing allocations, page protections, and access patterns.
    Interrupt Handler Analysis: Analyzes and logs interrupt handler executions, including frequency, duration, and associated ISR/DSR routines.
    File System Monitor: Monitors file system operations at the kernel level, providing insights into file creation, deletion, and access patterns.
    Performance Profiler: Profiles kernel operations to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
    Driver Communication Interface: A user-mode application to interact with the kernel module, providing a GUI for easier operation and visualization.
